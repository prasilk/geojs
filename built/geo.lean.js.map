Case insensitive.\n *   - `#rrggbbaa` The color and opacity specified in hexadecimal with each\n *     channel on a scale between 0 and 255 (`ff`).

Case insensitive.\n *   - `rgb(R, G, B)`, `rgb(R, G, B, A)`, `rgba(R, G, B)`, `rgba(R, G, B, A)`\n *     The color with the values of each color channel specified as numeric\n *     values between 0 and 255 or as percent (between 0 and 100) if a percent\n *     `%` follows the number.
